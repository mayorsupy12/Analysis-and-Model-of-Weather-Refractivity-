# Atmospheric Refractivity Analysis for Radio Wave Propagation Prediction
This project analyzes how atmospheric refractivity varies with altitude and temperature to model and predict radio frequency (RF) and electromagnetic wave propagation.
The goal is to enhance the accuracy of communication and radar systems by leveraging environmental data.

# Objectives
Understand how atmospheric refractivity changes with height and temperature.
Visualize refractivity trends using real or simulated atmospheric data.
Build a predictive model for radio wave propagation using this analysis.

# Tools 
Python: Data analysis and modeling.
Pandas & NumPy: Data preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
SciPy / Scikit-learn: Regression and model development.

# Key Outputs
Refractivity profiles based on environmental inputs.
Plots showing how refractivity varies with temperature and altitude.
Predictive model for estimating RF propagation range.
